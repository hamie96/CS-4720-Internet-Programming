<p>This is the text for the Resources chapter in 
<a href="../../GUIAppsUsingAndroid.pdf"><em>GUI Apps Using Android</em></a>, currently chapter 4.
It is more convenient to work in HTML at the moment than
LaTeX, used to create the PDF version.</p>

<p>From the Android guide to App Resources:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Resources are the additional files and static content that
your code uses, such as bitmaps, layout definitions, user interface strings, 
animation instructions, and more.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, thereâ€™s a lot of important components to an Android app,
or any application for that matter, than just the code.
Media, such as images, is just one example.
A less obvious resource is strings. 
By storing strings as a resource, rather than building them directly into a program
or user interface, we can make use of the Android facilities to
internationalize an application by providing labels and messages
in a language appropriate to the locale.</p>

<p>In this part, we wil first look at the types of resources that can be used
in an Android program.
We will only use a few of these types for now.
Then, we will examine how these resources can be provided in multiple versions
to match the environment.
We mentioned locale above, but we can also take into account screen size, as in
phone vs. tablet.
At the end of this part, we will study the raw form of resources files.
Other than bitmap files, resource files use XML to specify the structure of
the information contained in them.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Resources are stored in subdirectories of the <code>res</code> directory.
Note that no resources should be stored directly in <code>res</code>, only in subdirectories.
The Android guides provide a table 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#table1">Resource directories supported inside project res/ directory</a>
that shows how different types of resources are grouped.
If you examine the <code>res</code> folder in an existing Android project,
such as the one illustrated to the right, you will see some of the 
directories listed in the table.
You will also note some, like <code>drawable-hdpi</code> that are close to the directory names.
Those directories use <em>modifiers</em> described in the <a href="#resource-folder-modifiers">section below</a>.</p>

<p>We will be mainly concerned with three groups of resources:</p>

<dl id="folders">
  <dt>drawable</dt>
  <dd>As the name indicates, directories named <code>drawable</code> contain images.
  These might be bitmap images, as in the example at left.
  They could, however, be described in a text file using an XML vocabulary.</dd>
  <dt>layout</dt>
  <dd>Directory <code>layout</code> contains files that describe the look of the screen presented
  by an application. 
  There may be several screens for different modes of operation.
  Our first examples will use one layout for one screen.
  Later examples will demonstrate how to design and navigate multiple screens.
  Event though there are no modified version of <code>layout</code>, there could be different
  versions that depend, say, on the screen size.</dd>
  <dt>values</dt>
  <dd>Directories named <code>values</code> contain files that â€œcontain simple values, such as strings, integers, and colorsâ€�.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
  We can define strings here that will used to label parts of the user interface.
  We can also define the colors we use in a user interface.
  Centralizing the definitions in this way make it easier to change later.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The resources defined in the <code>res</code> subdirectories can be accessed from a layout.
However, they can also be accessed from Java code.<br />
This means resources can be used to customize all parts of an application.</p>

<p>Another advantage of resources, though not one that we will need, is that resources can 
be modified without recompiling the application code.
This means that an application could be unpacked and the resources modified and then
repacked.
This could be used to change the operation of an application,
though clearly this would not be appropriate for regular users.</p>

<h2 id="resource-folder-modifiers">Resource Folder Modifiers</h2>

<p>The Android system allows a developer to specify different versions of resources depending on the
configuration of the platform running an application.<br />
The Android guide section
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#AlternativeResources">Alternative Resources</a>
describes in detail what options are available and how they should be used.
The table of <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#table2">Configuration qualifier names</a>
lists all the currently available modifiers.
The order the modifiers appear in the table is important: 
a directory name may be modified by multiple qualifiers, but they must appear in the
order in which they appear in the table.</p>

<p>Files inside the various subdirectories may have arbitrary names, with an .xml extension.</p>

<p>The example folders shown above use the screen density modifiers for drawable.
The example also shows version modifiers for values.
It is recommended that, if you have some modified directory names, that you should
also have an unmodified directory containing <em>default versions</em> of all resources.
This prevents errors when some unanticipated combination of configurations on
a device conflict with all the qualified resources.</p>

<p>An unqualified resource folder is a default in that when no modifier fits or no resource name
matches otherwise, a resource in the default directory will be used.</p>

<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>

<p>It will be helpful to understand a little of the format used in the resource files, at least 
the ones in text format.
These all use a language scheme called <em>XML</em>.<br />
This looks very much like HTML, if you are familiar with that important web language.
Here is a short example from the <code>HelloName</code> application:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;string name="app_name"&gt;HelloName&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="hello_world"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="menu_settings"&gt;Settings&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="title_activity_main"&gt;Hello There&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="title"&gt;Enter Your Name!&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;string name="buttonLabel"&gt;Click This Button&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>First, XML is built around <em>tags</em>.<br />
These are the pieces of text surrounded by â€˜&lt;â€™ and â€˜&gt;â€™.
A <em>start tag</em>  begins with a word, after the opening â€˜&lt;â€™.
An <em>end tag</em> begins with â€˜/â€™ and then a word after the opening â€˜&lt;â€™.
In both kinds of tags, the word is called the <em>tag name</em>.
Other than optional spaces, an end tag contains nothing else before the closing
â€˜&gt;â€™.</p>

<p>Note that each start tag is matched with an end tag having the same name.
The part of the document from one start tag to its matching end tag is called
an <em>element</em>.
As can be seen above, an element may contain plain text between the two tags, as is
the case with all the â€˜stringâ€™ tags.
But, other elements may be contained between a start and end tag, such as with the
â€˜resourcesâ€™ tag.</p>

<p>Start tags can have extra content before the final â€˜&gt;â€™.
This content is called <em>attributes</em>.
Each attribute has a key, the word â€˜nameâ€™ in all the cases above, followed by 
an â€˜=â€™, followed by a quoted string.
The quoted string gives the <em>value of the attribute</em>.</p>

<p>There are several rules for the arrangements of tags in all XML documents:
* As mentioned above, each start tag must have a matching end tag.
* If a start tag appears inside an element, then its matching end tag must also be
	inside the element.
* There is one element that contains all the other elements in the document.
	This is called the <em>root element</em></p>

<p>There is one exception to the first rule, the so-called <em>empty tags</em>.
This is used for tags where there will never be any other content between the
start and the end tag.
For example, the &lt;br&gt; tag in HTML indicates a line break.
It would make no sense to put anything between &lt;br&gt; and &lt;/br&gt;.
So, XMl allows a shortcut: &lt;br/&gt;.
This empty tag takes the place of the combination of start and end tags.</p>

<p>Beyond the <em>syntax</em> of XML files, there is the <em>semantics</em>, the meaning.
It is reasonably easy to see in the resource file shown above that several
string resources are being defined.
The first one is a string resource named <code>app_name</code> which has the value <code>HelloName</code>.</p>

<p>There is one more refinement that should be mentioned.
Entering the tag &lt;br&gt; into the text of an HTML document, like this one,
would cause a line break.
So what had to be done to make the appear explicitly? 
The &lt; was replaced in each case by the <em>character entity</em>  &amp;lt;
in the original document. 
If you view the source of this web page, you can see this. 
There are five universal character entities.
Some systems, such as HTML browsers may define more.
Wikipedia lists the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Predefined_entities_in_XML">basic five</a>
as well as the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Character_entity_references_in_HTML">HTML character entities</a>.</p>
